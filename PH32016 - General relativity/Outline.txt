Learning Outcomes:	
After taking this unit the student should be able to: 
    deduce the motion of particles and light from given spacetime metrics; 
    account for the different predictions of general relativity and Newtonian gravity; 
    explain the properties of static and rotating black holes; 
    appreciate the problems of interfacing general relativity and quantum theory.
