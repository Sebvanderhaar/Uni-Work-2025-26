100% exam

Learning Outcomes:	
After taking the section on networks, the student should be able to:
    describe uses of networks in at least 2 different areas of science and technology;
    define, quantify and interpret some simple measures of network structure;
    explain methods for calculating more complex measures of network structure;
    derive and interpret structural measures for simple model networks;
    outline the key features of illustrative dynamic network models.
    After taking the section on quantum information the student should be able to:
    explain that information is physical, and critically appraise how this alters from the classical to quantum domain;
    explain in detail the concept of quantum entanglement, the EPR paradox, experimental tests of Bell's inequalities;
    illustrate uses of entanglement in quantum information protocols, such as quantum cryptography, dense coding and teleportation.
