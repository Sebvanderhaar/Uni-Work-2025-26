Learning Outcomes:	
After taking this unit, the student should be able to:
    describe examples of physical systems that exhibit nonlinear behaviour;
    use and justify the mathematical and numerical techniques used to study nonlinear systems;
    analyse simple nonlinear systems;
    explain what constitutes chaotic behaviour.


Content:	
    Single non-linear oscillator; 
    coupled oscillators; 
    non-linear waves and fields. 

    Key concepts to include: 
        resonant frequency shift, 
        stability, 
        bifurcation, 
        chaos, 
        solitary waves. 
    
    Physical examples will be taken from across a wide range of fields, 
        including photonics, 
        electronics, 
        ecology & biophysics,
        fluid dynamics.
