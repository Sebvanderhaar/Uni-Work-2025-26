Learning Outcomes:	
After taking this unit, the student should be able to:
    de-dimensionalise an equation representing a physical system;
    discretise a differential equation using grid and basis set methods;
    outline the essential features of each of the simulation techniques introduced and give examples of their use in contemporary science;
    identify the strengths and weaknesses of a computational approach to modelling;
    demonstrate practical application of computational techniques to selected physics problems;
    explain the methodology, relevant issues and output of the investigations performed.
